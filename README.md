# SandalwoodFire

This repository contains an IPYNB file from Google Colaboratory. The file creates a map of the burned areas of California (primarily in Calimesa) from the Sandalwood fire and calculates the extent of the fire. This method does identify three smaller areas as burned which were likely not. The burn area calculated is approximately 985 acres. According to CALFIRE 1011 acres were burned.
